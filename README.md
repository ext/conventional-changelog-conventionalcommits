A concrete implementation of the specification described at
[conventionalcommits.org](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for automated
CHANGELOG generation and version management.

TODO: once we flesh out the spec for configuring conventional-changelog tools,
fill in this section of the README [see](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-config-spec/issues/1).
